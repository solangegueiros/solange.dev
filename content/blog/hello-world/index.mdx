Hello World, 

This is my Blockchain Developers Blog.

I spent some time in the last week of 2019 researching about blog tools and decided to learning Gatsby to build it.

I started to do some posts.

Also I published all talks, workshops and interviews since 2019.
Even publishing some past events in the coming weeks, they will have the original date of the event.

Some things are in Portuguese, others are in English or Spanish.
