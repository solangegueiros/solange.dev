Bounties: Waves Platform https://github.com/ethberlinzwei/KnowledgeBase/blob/master/resources/wavesplatform.md

### Description
My project at Hackaton EthBerlin 2019

A two user bet game using ride programming language at waves platform

### Inspiration
To learn new things

### What it does
It is a game for two players.

One player wins when his bet is equal or greater than 2 times the other bet.

### How I built it
I use Visual Studio Code.

I did the scripts using ride programming language.

I tested with surfboard.

### Challenges I ran into
It was very difficult because the programming language is so diferent and I do no have much base on the concepts.

### Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I almost gave up because I couldn't even change the basic example and didn't have dawn support. But I insisted and finished my idea.

### What I learned
I learned ride programming language and the basic at waves platform.

### What's next
I would like to do more tests and a frontend.

### Built With
javascript
ride
waves
