Realmente foi o conceito de um “camp”, onde passamos 4 dias imersos no universo IPFS.
Tivemos cursos apresentando o core do IPFS, diversos aspectos e utilizações como Infraestrutura e Identidade, além de discussão de tópicos com apresentação de posters, aprofundamento de aspectos do IPFS, projetos do ecossistema e áreas abertas para divulgação de trabalhos.

Na parte Unconf eu apresentei a Janus Plataform, ferramenta para publicação, indexação e busca para sites publicados em ambiente descentralizado - web3, desenvolvido pela 4cadia.


# Janus Platform : Index and Search in web3

## Context
### Some statistics
Over 1.94 billion websites online.<br/>
Over 63,000 searches per second on any given day.<br/>
Google is the world’s most visited website.<br/>
<br/>
3–4 searches every single day per person.<br/>
30,000 Websites are hacked A DAY.<br/>
Cost of cybercrime damages will cost $6 trillion annually.<br/>
93% of data breaches happen within minutes.<br/>
83% aren’t discovered for weeks.<br/>
<br/>
If the web was decentralized, that would be different.  <br/>
That's why we are working on Janus Platform. <br/>
The Ethereum Blockchain system that allows users to register, store and explore the real 3.0 web.<br/>
<br/>
## Why IPFS?
### Documentation
After analyzing some similar technologies we found IPFS Documentation the most complete and trustable.
### Decentralized
We were looking for a total decentralized and distributed technology as long as a trustable network with some applications already being used
### Integrated.
In our experience, to integrate the project to IPFS was easy and viable as the Docs were very helpful
### File Storage.
We managed to use IPFS as a File Storage for any kind of web application.
### SPA Host
IPFS was used as a Web Server making it possible to distribute our DAPPs as well. 
<br/>
## Janus Platform
We build a set of tools to help to build the decentralized web.
<br/>
### Indexer: JANUSNDXR and Janus web app
It is a easy way to publish and index your web site in the decentralized web.<br/>
We use a Ethereum Smart Contract to index the keywords present at index.html in website.<br/>
#### JANUSNDXR (Janus-CLI)
It is a Command Line Interface (CLI), for technical users, with some knowledge on development.<br/> 
More types of apps and make the process of deploy fast and easy thru the terminal.<br/> 
#### Janus web app
This is a DApp with a friendly interface making it easy to upload and index Web 3.0 content.<br/>  
It is intuitive and communicate directly with the blockchain being needless to use command lines or technical blockchain knowledge.<br/> 
### Search: Janus Searcher
Here the users can explore the Web 3.0. <br/>
We made a platform validated by the most recent UX techniques to make our searcher intuitive and comfortable for the users. <br/>
You can enter keywords and find all pages related to it, as usual in most search interfaces now a days. <br/>
